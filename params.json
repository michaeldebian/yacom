YACOM seeks to integrate with KVM and the container technology in an API format. The vision is to allow the average system administrator/Devops engineer to have a ready to work platform in the matter of minutes.\r\n\r\n                                ** What will YACOM's contain? **\r\n\r\n- Login platform for users (developers to create servers), for admins to change resource settings.\r\n- Integration with CI/CD technologies facilitating a ready to go solution.\r\n- SSH into multiple machines in parallel.\r\n- Server Taxonomy to group servers by location, application, cluster, etc.\r\n- Autonomous, which will migrate guests among hosts.\r\n- Support for running different command in languages such us shell, powershell, node, python, ruby, java, among others.\r\n- Scheduling mechanism to schedule tasks and notify admins via email, sms.\r\n\r\n                                        ** Containers**\r\n\r\n- YACOM seeks to provide an API interface to kubernetes as well as github, making it easy for developers to obtain resources within the enterprise.\r\n- Kubernetes under the covers will manage the containers.\r\n- It will apply the best practices in case of failure, by either doing it autonomically or consulting the sysadmin.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
