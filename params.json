  "body": "                        Yacom (Yet Another Container Openstack Manager)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of YACOM is to provide an alternative to Openstack, but in a much simplified manner. YACOM seeks to integrate with KVM (building a swagger API and a pre-built Centos/Ubuntu image). The vision is to allow the average system administrator/Devops engineer to have a ready to work  self provisioning platform in a matter of minutes.\r\n\r\n                             What will YACOM's contain? \r\n\r\nDevelopers\r\n- Self Serve platform to create servers (Something like Digital Ocean for the enterprise)\r\n- Support for running different command in languages such us shell, powershell, node, python, ruby, java, among others.\r\n- Be able to predefined actions with a push of a button (restart apps, restart process, perform an action if process is not running).\r\n\r\nCI/CD\r\n- Integration with github to release new code and rollback.\r\n- Rewrite it in nodejs enhancing https://github.com/shipitjs/shipit-deploy\r\n\r\nSysadmin\r\n- Scheduling mechanism to schedule tasks and notify admins via email, sms.\r\n- Autonomous, which will migrate guests among hosts.- SSH into multiple machines in parallel.\r\n- Server Taxonomy to group servers by location, application, cluster, etc.\r\n- Execute commands to windows and linux servers\r\n- Ability to create predefined templates for server provisioning.\r\n\r\n                                       Containers\r\n\r\n- YACOM seeks to provide an API interface to kubernetes as well as github, making it easy for developers to obtain resources within the enterprise.\r\n- Kubernetes under the covers will manage the containers.\r\n- It will apply the best practices in case of failure, by either doing it autonomically or consulting the sysadmin.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
