It will allow developers to  easily build docker images (CentOS, Ubuntu and SmartOS), create/destroy instances, deploy in parallel to hundreds of servers, add a preconfigured nginx proxy server for your ruby,nodejs application . The vision is to allow a single point of management for DEVOPS/Software Engineers which will allow them to add/remove Docker instances on the fly, allowing developers to focus 100% on the code, also, it will add/remove instances to/from load balancers, in this case we will use dedicated instances running nginx.\r\n\r\n                                 YACOM Architecture\r\n\r\n- Proxy server (nginx)\r\n- Rsync image repo with docker nodes\r\n- Easy to build images on demand\r\n- Reporting capabilities for management per charge code (department)\r\n- Reporting for admins for resource utilization (pool management)\r\n- Cassandra based\r\n\r\n                                 Technologies\r\n\r\nBackend\r\n- SmartOS\r\n- Vagrant\r\n- VirtualBox\r\n\r\nTools\r\n- Nginx -Preconfigured per project\r\n- Bittorrent - For deployments\r\n- Github\r\n- ShipitJS\r\n\r\nFramework\r\n- Electron (frontend)\r\n- Node-ExpressJS (backend)\r\n- Minio.io\r\n\r\n                             What will YACOM's contain? \r\n\r\n\r\n- Spin up/down containers.\r\n- Generate security keys.\r\n- Edit/save YAML files online.\r\n- Support for running different command in languages such us shell, powershell, node, python, ruby, java, among others.\r\n- Be able to predefined actions with a push of a button (restart apps, restart process, perform an action if process is not running).\r\n\r\nCI/CD\r\n- Integration with github to release new code and rollback.\r\n- Rewrite it in nodejs enhancing https://github.com/shipitjs/shipit-deploy\r\n- Integration with bit torrent based releases.\r\n\r\nSysadmin\r\n- Scheduling mechanism to schedule tasks and notify admins via email, sms.\r\n- Autonomous, which will migrate guests among hosts.- SSH into multiple machines in parallel.\r\n- Server Taxonomy to group servers by location, application, cluster, etc.\r\n- Execute commands to windows and linux servers\r\n- Ability to create predefined templates for server provisioning.\r\n\r\n                                       Containers\r\n\r\n- YACOM seeks to provide an API interface to kubernetes as well as github, making it easy for developers to obtain resources within the enterprise.\r\n- It will apply the best practices in case of failure, by either doing it autonomic ally or consulting the sysadmin.\r\n- Autoscaling capabilities based on rules predefined by admin.\r\n\r\n",
